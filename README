This QGis plugin allows for layers or groups to be displayed in a loop.

The plugin interface is a small dock widget which should appear in the left dock when the plugin is activated.

The "Select Group" selection allows to define the source for the layers to loop.
Select <Visible Layers> to select visible layers (the ones checked in the Layers legend).
Select <Root> to use the top-level items (layers or groups) in the Layers legend.
If there are any groups in the layers legend, these should appear in the selector.
Currently the selector is not refreshed automatically, so use the Refresh button when needed. 

Select the loop delay in seconds.

The Controls are Play/Pause, Stop, Next.


============================================================
TODO

- fix groups - cannot have identical names and nested groups are added to groups/layers to loop unnecessarily
- add one-shot timers instead of programmed one
- update the groups list (and internal representations) automatically
